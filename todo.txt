- Finish delete, edge cases?
edge cases:
Insert:
    - tree is 2 way (ie one val per leaf) causes imbalances
    - problem with nodes being dropped on insert somehow, but still remaining in linked list 
    - Parent nodes?

Delete: 
    - crash if mway is 2
    - make sure next/prev/parent pointers mostly are ok
    - haven't handled all edge cases
